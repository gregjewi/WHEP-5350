``Talking about last lecture. About how stationarity, or nonstationarity, make prediction of future flood probabilities difficult.``

``Humans are to blame for it, both through climate change and landuse changes. Makes stationarity dead.``


``Today we are going to talk about reservoirs.``


Reservoirs; Definition
=======================

**Definition**: engineering structures that store water.

	Use cases:
		- Municipal Water Supply Reservoirs
		- Irrigation Reservoirs
		- Flood Control Reservoirs
		- Hydropower
		- Recreation

	Types:
		- Storage Reservoirs (ex: Big Dam)
			* Inflow *uncontrolled*
			* Outflow *controlled*
		- Distribution Reservoirs (ex: Water Tank)
			* Inflow *controlled*
			* Outflow *uncontrolled*

``Control Volume, S, is the storage in the reservoir``

Inflows:

	- Precipitation, :math:`P`
	- Groundwater Inflow, :math:`G_i`
	- Surface Inflow, :math:`Q_i`

Outflows:

	- Evaporation, :math:`E`
	- Groundwater Outflow (Seepage), :math:`G_o`
	- Diversions, :math:`D`
	- Outflows, :math:`Q_{o}`

So,

:math:`\Delta S = (P - E) + (Q_i - Q_o) + (G_i - G_o) - D`

**Simplification For A Flood Control Reservoir**

:math:`\Delta S \approx Q_i - Q_o`

:math:`\Delta t \sim [minutes-to-hours-to-days?]`

``Can ignore everything else, though may need to pay attention to the precipitation falling on the reservoir area IF the surface area is a significant percentage of the basin.``


Can integrate over the :math:`\Delta S(t)` hydrograph to determine a volume measure.


**Simplification For an Irrigation**

Calculate the "net inflow", :math:`Q_{in,net}`

:math:`\Delta S = Q_i + P - E + (G_i - G_o) - Q_o - D`
