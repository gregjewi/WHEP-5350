=======================

Today we finished up with the water plan presentations.
- Texas
- India
- Turkey River
- California


Now we're going to talk about the water cycle.

Water Cycle Components
------------------------

``Analyzing a watershed via the first principles of the water cycle``

Looking at English River watershed. 
"Normal precipitation" to NOAA NCDC means a 30-year mean. 
Iowa sees more precipitation (peak) in early summer, latespring (April - June) then decreases back to autumn.


Annual Water Cycle for the English River Watershed:
	- Pricipation: 36.5 in. (100%)
	- Evaporation: 25.3 in. (69%)
	- Streamflow: 11.2 in. (31%)

Evaporation is a very high proportion of total precip for this gauge.

Flow in the river channel (measured at a gauge) can be partioned into:
	- Streamflow (direct runoff)
	- Baseflow (groundwater based)

For the English River:
	- Total Streamflow: 11.2 in (100%)
	- Direct Runoff: 5.0 in (45%)
	- Baseflow: 6.2 in (55%)


Can look at the flood events (Climatologically).
For the Enlish River at Kalona there are 25 flood events in 75 years (about 33% of the years).
Can plot them on a single year scale (Jan - Dec) and make inferences about the time of year that floods occur on.


``Reviewing the Project 1 directions now.``

Project 1 Notes
----------------

1. Find a stream gauge that isn't regulated.
