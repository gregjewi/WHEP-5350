Water Balance
---------------------

Conservation of Mass primary form is:

	:math:`\Delta S = \bar{I} - \bar{Q}`

	where:

		:math:`\Delta S` : Change in Storage
		:math:`\bar{I}`: Inflow
		:math:`\bar{Q}` : Outflow

	One note is the timestep or :math:`\Delta t` is user-defined (month, day, year, etc.)

	Units:

		* kg
		* cubic meters [m^3]
		* :math:`\frac{ft}{sec} * day`
		* milimeters [mm]


Another form of Conservation of Mass is:

	:math:`\frac{\Delta S}{\Delta t} = I - Q`

	or

	:math:`\frac{dS}{dt} = I - Q`


Land Surface "Water Budget"
----------------------------
``He's drawing a picture of a control volume that includes "Johnson County" land surface, subsurface, atmosphere just above the ground.``

Inflows:
	- Precip
	- Q in
	- Groundwater Inflow

Outflows:
	- ET
	- Q out
	- Groundwater Out

Math looks like:

:math:`\Delta S = (P - E) + (Q_i - Q_o) + (G_i - G_o)`
 
``Can make a simplification if you define your control volume as a watershed boundary instead of political boundaries.``

``Assume drainage divide for subsurface is approximately the same as surface boundary``

Math simplifies to:

:math:`\Delta S = P - E - Q_o`

Over the long term :math:`\Delta S = 0`, and so we can rewrite the equation as:

:math:`\Delta S \approx 0 = P - E - Q_o`

or

:math:`P = E + Q_o`


Delineation of a Watershed
---------------------------
Do it by hand. Cross elevations perpendicularly. Cross check with online tools.
