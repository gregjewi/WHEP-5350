Flood Probability
===================

Define our random variable

:math:`X_i`

Which is the largst peak discharge in year i.

Events (flood)

:math:`\{X_i \geq x_p\}` is a flood event

:math:`P\{X_i \geq x_p\} = p` execedance probability



Probability Theory
--------------------

**Random Variables**

:math:`P\{flood\} + P\{NoFlood\} = 1` is the total probability.

:math:`P\{NoFlood\} = 1 - P\{flood\}`

:math:`P\{X_i < x_p\} = 1 - p` Non-excedance probability


**Independence**

:math:`P\{No Flood in 2 years\} = P\{No Flood, Yr 1\} * P\{No Flood, Yr 2\}`

:math:`P\{No Flood in 2 years\} = (1-p)(1-p)`

:math:`P\{No Flood in M Years\} = (1-p)(1-p)...(1-p) = (1-p)^M`

**Risk**

:math:`R = P\{At Least 1 event in M years\}`
:math:`R = 1 - P\{No Floods in M years\}`
:math:`R = 1 - (1 - p)^M`



Return Period
---------------

``Drawing a timeline with a flood threshold dotted line``

``Charting over time the occurence of a flood event``

``The time between each occurence is called the RECURRENCE INTERVAL``

Define: T, **return period**, average recurrence interval of a given event.

:math:`T = \frac{1}{p}`



Frequency Analysis
-------------------

Estimate probabilities from sample data.

Typical Frequency Analysis problems

If :math:`x_p` is known --> what is the probability, :math:`P` that it is exceeded? Estimate :math:`p(\hat{p})` or :math:`T(\hat{T})`

``Hats mean estimates``


If :math:`p` or :math:`T` known --> estimate :math:`x_p(\hat{x_p})` or :math:`x_t(\hat{x_T})`


US Federal Method - Bulletin 17C
-------------------------------------
**Log Pearson Type III Distribution**

- Take the logarithms of sample data 
	:math:`y_i = log(Q_i)` where :math:`i = 1,..,N`

- Estimate Moments
	:math:`\mu_y,\sigma_y,\gamma_y` which are estimated from :math:`\hat{\mu_y}, \hat{\sigma_y}, \hat{\gamma_y}`

	These are mean, standard deviation, skew coefficient

- Find a weighted skew coefficient :math:`\hat{\gamma_w}`
	:math:`\hat{\gamma_R}, \hat{MSE_{\gamma_R}}`

- Quantile Estimate
	:math:`log{\hat{Q_T}} = \hat{\mu_y} + K(T,\hat{\gamma_w}) * \hat{\sigma_y}`


``There's a discussion on the regional skew estimate.``
``Iowa's study resulted in a regional skew of -0.40``
