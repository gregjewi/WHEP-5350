2/1/2019 Notes
=======================

``Begin the course with a review of different people's watershed climatology reports!``

``Note: have to read the paper in ICON before Monday's class``

Baseflow
==========

Today we are talking about baseflow.

``He's talking about the response of baseflow as a part of the total hydrograph.``

- **Direct Runoff** or Quick Response doesn't necessarily need to be thought of as land surface runoff. Can pass through drains, for example. Instead like to refer to the as Direct Runnoff, a quick response.


In order to separate Baseflow from Direct Runoff, you can use filtering techniques for baseflow separation.

The tuning of the filtering routine is a bit subjective, as you can see in the image above.


Flood Climatology
===================

Another way to analyze the climatology of a stream is to look at flows above a flood "threshold".

Plot by calendar day can provide information on the occurence of the flood events.


Flood Frequency
======================

Can use all of the peak annual data's to do a Flood Frequency analysis.

``We're going to be using USGS's peakFQ software....``
